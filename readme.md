# todo

Perhaps there is some order in this list but it's mostly so I can remember what features I think are missing and I want to add

* Generate tag pages
* Copy meta-files such as image
* Implement markdeep
* Add verification steps to make sure code samples can be compiled and (unit) tested
  - compile code without errors
  - test and run and check against code output in another code sample or special comments in the original sample
* Add support for generating images using code
  - for example using processing
  - custom code that outputs images or svg
